# Setting up the Pi

In this lesson we will get familiar with the Raspberry Pi (Pi), learning how to set it up, and what kind of things it can do.

## Let's set it up first

1. Make sure your monitor is on your desk, plugged in, and turned on.
2. Connect your HDMI cable to the VGA adaptor, and plug the VGA adaptor into the monitor.
3. We now need to put the Pi inside its protective case. Take the top and side covers off the case, then unclip the top of the box from the bottom. Now, very gently put the actual computer inside the case — there are four little plastic pins that you will need to line up with the corresponding holes in the Raspberry Pi. <strong>Be very gentle with the computer, and hold it on the edges — don't touch anything otherwise you might damage it.</strong> Once it is in, put the box top and covers back on.
4. Next, we need to insert the Micro SD card into the bottom of the Pi. This contains the computer's entire operating system and storage space. One you've turned the Pi upsidedown, the card needs to be inserted with the thin end towards the slot, and the writing pointing up. <strong>This is also really fragile, so be really careful</strong>.
5. Now we need to plug things into the computer. You need to plug:
** The keyboard and mouse into a USB port each.
** The end of the HDMI cable that isn't plugged into the TV into the HDMI port
** <strong>THE VERY LAST STEP</strong> — The power cable into the mains electricity socket, and then plug the other end of it — the Micro USB plug — into the Micro USB socket. This will turn the Raspberry Pi on, and you'll start to see it boot up.

## Connecting your Pi to the internet

The Pi has Wifi, just like most other modern computing devices. Once on, the Pi will automatically detect nearby networks, and they will appear in the Wifi menu (see the icon on the top right hand side, which looks like a wedge). We just need to select the school network, and log on to it.

We need to get this done first, as much of the stuff we want to do needs the Internet!

## A quick tour of the Pi's hardware

We've already walked around most of the hardware. You'll see that it's also got:

* Two more USB ports to attach other hardware into — very useful.
* A headphone jack to plug headphones or speakers into, so you can have sound.
* A networking cable so you can plug the Pi directly into a network (e.g. a router for internet access).
* 40 connector pins, which allow you to connect hardware devices directly to the Pi's motherboard. This is really cool, as it allows you to do your own electronics experiments. It has power pins (to provide power), ground pins (to complete a circuit), and GPIO pins (that allow hardware to be controlled with code). [This tutorial explains more about the connector pins](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing).

## A quick tour of the Pi's software

The Pi comes with a lot of really cool and useful software, making it great for learning:

* Programming environments like Scratch, Sonic Pi, Wolfram/Mathematica, and IDEs for Java and Python.
* LibreOffice programs to allow you to create documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.
* The Epithany web browser, to provide basic internet access.

## Shutting down

At the end of each session, you need to shut down your Pi properly to ensure it doesn't suffer any problems (like data corruption).

1. Go to Menu and choose the Shutdown option
2. Press OK on the resulting dialog box.
3. Make sure the computer has completely finished shutting down (it stops flashing and goes completely black), then pull the power lead out of its socket.
4. Put everything away tidily!
