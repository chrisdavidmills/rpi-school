# Raspberry Pi school

Hello! This is a ten week course aimed at teaching children the very basics of Raspberry Pi â€” how fun it can be, and what a great learning tool it is.

The aim here is not to become experts in Raspberry Pi, but to provide a taster, and get you interested in learning more!

## Required hardware

Each student (or group) will need as a bare minimum the hardware detailed in the [Raspberry Pi Hardware Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/hardware-guide/). This includes:

* A Raspberry Pi (preferably a Pi 3 model B with a protective case, like the [official starter kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-Official-Desktop-Starter/dp/B01CI5879A/)).
* A monitor or TV to connect your Pi to. The Pi connects to a display via an HDMI port, so make sure you have an adapter if your monitor doesn't have an HDMI port.
* An HDMI cable to connect your Pi to your monitor.
* A USB keyboard.
* A USB mouse.
* A power supply to connect your Pi to the mains (provided in the starter kit mentioned above).
* A Micro USB card with the Noobs operating system installed (provided in the starter kit mentioned above).

optionally, if you want to play with hardware hacking, it is a good idea to get hold of a [physical computing kit](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing). This should include at least:

* A solderless breadboard
* Jumper leads
* Resistors
* LEDs
